This project a collaboration of designers (permaculture and software).  The aim is the creation of a tool for designing complex polycultures.  The core of the application will be a robust plant database which will eventually be expanded to include other 'elements' (eg. animals, structures etc.).

The project is in the very early stages.  If you would like to be involved, contact michael - ludlow1914@hotmail.com.
